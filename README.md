Cryptocurrency for project Apogeios. Value of the currency system grows as the quality of certain media IP based SW stack grows even better, the ecosystem grows stronger and the inhabitants of Apogeios internalizes more sense of quality.

2AM, 3/18 Shanghai time, woke up. Thanks to dearest Budha. All of a sudden, the ideas just swamped in from nowhere.

There are two major challenges to lead Apogeios inhabitants through the transformation.
1. Awareness of quality and what exactly quality means for a genearl SW stack and a good SW ecosystem. In most cases, the inhabitants skip necessary pondering of quality not because they do not care or they are ignorant. Instead, they do not know exactly what quality means and what possible measurements for quality improvements.
2. Encouragement of extra efforts (always in risk of delaying of workload at hand) for better quality. Everyone rushes for getting things done faster for shorter term targets while the flaws usually fire back sooner and later and will incur more work days to fix them.

The transformation does not nececessily have to be any connections to block chain based cryptocurrency which can be overkill, but the popularity of blockchain and all hypos built around it could give a nudge to the transformation. And beyond that blockchain based cryptocurrency does bring foundamental benefits to resolve the challenges. It offers a quantiative metrics of quality improvement efforts which can be recognized in a specific concensus algorithm. The concensus algorithm plays a most wanted vision - quality recognition is better to be decentralized and self-organized regardless a potentially practical application in Apogeios that we need a hybrid approach in the beginning.

Crytocurrency encourages risk taking of extra efforts for better quality. Not just the number increase in personal balance account is a psychological reward but also the potential possibility of cashing out through standard on the Earth reward system. Benefits or penalities of anomymity nature of cryptocurrency in this application is arguable but should not be a big concern either way. On the other hand, it opens an opporutnity to encourage those who endorses final schedule and work assignments to allow more risk taking because the protocol can be designed to reduce their balance otherwise.

Besides quality improvement efforts would be rewarded as a balance increase, unintentional consequences of compromising quality from undisciplined operation could result in balance deduction. How much the system should apply this would require a thoughtful consideration. Apparently it should not hurt the positive encouragement especially in the early phase when the system rolls out.  

Another subtle benefit reside in the essence of any currency. Currency is all about trust. In Apogeios application, the trust is a common sense (consensus) of SW quality. More inhabitants understand (trust) quality and want to spend more energy in quality efforts, bigger value the currency system will hold.

# consensus protocol
There are a few requirements for consensus protocol design.

1. PoS or PoW. PoW is certainly out of question. PoS, on the other hand, requires thoughful consideration to ensure economic incentives and penalites are effective.
2. Miners. Who, how, awards?

Finality is not a concern of the cyptocurrency design. The individual or group of inhabitant to conduct the efforts can choose to be anonymous or not. All quality efforts take days or weeks or months to complete. Final ownership will be claimed only when the efforts are completed.

Attacks are out of question.

# challenges

1. Interoperability with existing tools/process.

2. Psychological safety. This is an interesting experiment to pratice some rigid logic/science in management art. Psychological safety could be a major concern for all inhabitants. Inhabitants could easily connect the amount of cryptocurrency in their balance account to their performance on the Earth. On the other hand, if inhabitants take this easy as a game w/o concerns of real on the Earth penalities and rewards, it makes it easy for the quality sense interlization.

3. Inflation.
